# Background

I made a game with the same premise as this when I was first learning how to code. When looking back on it, it was written incredibly poorly since I was just learning, so I decided to go back and redo it with more organized code. Not complete yet, but should function to some extent, just not able to do every action yet.

## Usage

    python3 main.py

## TODO

* Implement building 
* Implement fishing

## Other Ideas
* Deploy as an App
    * Integrate with a database to keep track of best scores
